This project was made alone


Chores :

  Typescript for error handling & easier management of file uploads,role management
  Role management ( done )
  Refacto of api router ( done )
  Write tests
  Add geolocation management in controllers instead of calling all created posts


# Requirements

Either run with Docker & run the following commands on first install ( The container has PSQL and a pgadmin instance for development purposes )

  npm run build-db && npm run init-db && npm run prep-db

Once this is done :

  npm run start


# Dependecies

NodeJs
Express
Postgres
Sequelize
cookie-parser
axios
body-parser
multer


Only One ressource was made without the ORM , the "fun" controller which listed methods where third party apis are called.

 Used MiddleWare :

 Role Checker
 Used to check user roles for deletion of ressources ( only a super-admin can change account status , only the author can delete his own resources ( posts & comments ))

 Uploads

 At the moment , only image uploads are supported ( & testable with the two html forms but not in a template engine as I was more interested in uploading images & from an html form which ressembles the most to the form I'm using on my vueJS app (which you can check either at https://memory-f31e8.web.app/ but I haven't deployed the api to my vps yet  or on the following ))

 The postman collection is in the repo as MemoryLaneApiCallsCollection

This is not a finished project , I'm well aware of it, and as it is a
